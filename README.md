This is a Java application that generates crosswords using a Genetic Algorithm. 

To use the application, follow these steps:
1. Place your input files in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the application. The Genetic Algorithm will generate a crossword based on your inputs.
3. Check the 'outputs' folder in the root directory. This folder will contain result files, which provide the coordinates and orientations of the words in the crossword.
4. The crossword is also displayed in the standard console output for quick reference.
